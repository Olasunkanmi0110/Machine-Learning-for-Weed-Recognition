# Machine-Learning-for-Weed-Recognition
Globally, accurate weed classification is vital for sustainable farming. The application of machine learning techniques enables precise weed recognition, helping farmers distinguish harmful species from crops, reduce herbicide use, and improve yield through targeted weed management strategies.

Each model's performance was assessed using its accuracy on the training, validation, and test datasets. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved 92.00% accuracy on training data but dropped to 84.81% on the test set, indicating a slight decline in generalisation—comparable to a student excelling in classwork but underperforming in an external exam. Logistic Regression outperformed SVM with accuracies of 93.00% (training) and 88.60% (test), showing better adaptability to new data. The K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) model, however, declined from 88.00% in training to 78.48% in testing—suggesting overfitting, similar to someone who memorises past questions but struggles with new formats.

The Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) with two dense layers performed strongly, with test accuracy reaching 96.67%, showing a solid grasp of the data. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) excelled further with 97.00% training and 96.20% test accuracy. This reflects CNN’s real-world utility in medical imaging or facial recognition, where detailed feature extraction is crucial.
